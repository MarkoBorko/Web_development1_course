Homework 8.2: Guess the secret number

We have a first customer - a local Casino! They want to expand their business to computer gambling so they want us to build a 
gambling game for them. For the beginning something small and simple - a game called Guess the secret number.

Your task is to create this game:
First "hard-code" some number in the program (write the number into a variable). You can call this variable secret.
Then the user has to find out what this number is (using input()). Store user's guess in a variable called guess.
Check if your secret is equal to user's guess.
If the user's guess is wrong, let him/her know that (use print() and if/else).
If the user's guess is correct, congratulate him/her.

When you finish, upload the code to GitHub and share the link to it on SmartNinja Slack.

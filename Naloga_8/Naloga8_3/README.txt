Write a program that does the basic arithmetic operations:

addition (+),
subtraction (-),
multiplication (*),
and division (/).

Ask the user to enter two numbers and the arithemtic operation ("+", "-", "*" or "/").

Then use if/elif/else statements to do the right operation. A hint:
if operation == "+":

When you finish, upload the code to GitHub and share the link to it on SmartNinja Slack.

Exercise 9.1: Unit converter

Create a program that converts units. More specifically, kilometers into miles.

First create a plan for this program. Together with the instructor define the steps the user will take when using the program.

Plan:
The program greets user and describes what's the purpose of the program.
The program asks user to enter number of kilometers.
User enters the amount of kilometers.
The program converts these kilometers into miles and prints them.
The program asks user if s/he'd want to do another conversion.
If yes, repeat the above process (except the greeting).
If not, the program says goodbye and stops.
The program should constantly run as long as the user would want to do conversions.

When you finish, push your code on GitHub and share it on the SmartNinja Slack.

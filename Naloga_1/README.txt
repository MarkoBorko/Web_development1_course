Homework 1.1: Fakebook

Now that you know the basics of HTML, you're ready to build your first project - your very own social network!
Don't worry, it's not as hard as it sounds. You will only build an example of your profile on this imaginary social network called
Fakebook. And you'll use HTML for that.

But before you start, set up the new project environment. Open PyCharm, click on Create New Project and create the
Fakebook project (the same way as earlier in this lesson).
Now you can start building you Fakebook profile with the HTML language you just learned.
It will probably look something like this: https://storage.googleapis.com/smartninja-org-assets/curriculums/cw/de/fb-de.html.

When you finish the project, paste the code you build into GitHub Gist: https://gist.github.com/ and share it on Slack. 
It will serve you there as a proof of you first coding project. :)
